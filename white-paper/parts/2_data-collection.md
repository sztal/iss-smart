# Data collection
For each country^[
    The exact set of countries that will be considered is being worked out
    at the time of writing of this paper.
] a list of leading weekly opinion magazines (actors) will be established based
on industry rankings of circulation (up to ten biggest titles will be included).
Then, for each title a year-long history of _Facebook_ posts will be extracted.
This will include both posts content, numbers of reactions and shares as well as
`URLs` of any linked articles. _Facebook_ data extraction will be carried through
by our business partner [_Sotrender_](https://www.sotrender.com). Gathered article
links will be subsequently used to scrape actual content of articles from
publishers websites. Hence, the final corpus of documents for a given country
will consist of a set of _Facebook_ posts and content of linked articles as well as
basic information on social media reactions. This will enable narratives
discovery as well as analysis of discourse of specific actors and assessment
of similarity between various actors.
