Narratives can be defined as prevalent ways of thinking and telling about the world,
especially in the context of important social and policy issues, which have a broad
but not necessarily unequivocal social support. As such, they have a power
to shape public opinion and decision making. They can be used to mobilize
social support both for good and bad. This seems to be especially important
in this historical moment when the new media landscape has fundamentally reshaped
our collective means of communication facilitating local and global cooperation
but also providing entirely new tools of propaganda and misinformation,
which are often popularly referred to as _fake news_. Also it is quite apparent
that many European societies are rapidly changing and entangled in often heated
and very polarizing public debates and conflicts. This social rupture seems
to be at least partially resulting from a significant decrease of the pool
of shared societal norms and values, and this in turn can be thought of as a result
of coexistence of competitvie and outrightly incompatible narratives concerning
very foundations of social and political life. Hence, understanding of what are
the narratives that are shaping our current historical moment in Europe seems
to be of crucial importance. Such a knowledge would help identify not only
the points of the most ferocious discoursive conflicts but also and perhaps
more importantly the remaining issues and values that are still common for everyone.

The aim of this research is to develop and apply an empirical method of measuring
and describing social narratives. The main objective is to describe the current
most prevalent narratives that shape social lifes in various European countries
as well as identify most conflictual and shared regions of discoursive space.

Due to preliminary and pioneering character of the project a scope of the analysis
had to be carefuly chosen and somewhat limited. Only narratives as presented
in the discourse of leading weekly opinion magazines will be considered.
This approach is favourable as it can provide a clear-cut definition and enumeration
of data sources. At the same time opinion magazines are important actors that
both influence and reflect the state of important public debates and as such
can be considered good proxies for estimating general public narrative dynamics.
