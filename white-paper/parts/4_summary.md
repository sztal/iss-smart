# Summary

The analysis will hopefully not only provide useful information on prevalent
discourses that shape public opinion in Europe, but will also shed some light on
the question of which issues can be used to bring more people together. This
seems to be an important problem in the context of contemporary media landscape
which often tend to unnecessarily amplify social divisions.

Moreover, it is hoped that this pilot study will constitute a good starting point
for developing a framework for systemic studying of public discourse.
