\abstract{
    This white paper provides a self-contained, high-level overview of the
    methodology of narrative analysis that is the subject of workpackage ???.
    The goal is to detect and describe most prevalent narratives concerning
    social and policy issues, especially in relation to EU, as perceived through
    discourse in leading weekly opinion magazines in various european countries.
    The analysis will combine modern quantitative approaches
    (collection of big data from social networks and unsupervised machine learning)
    with qualitative insights in order to produce in-depth and actionable results.
